# Parking Simulation

Self-Parking car simulation using Reinforcement Learning.

## Descriptionv

Self-driving car tries to park using reinforcement learning - it is giving a reward when car gets closer to goal, if it gets far from the goal it loses the reward. That's how it learns to get closer to the goal and finally park itself. We used pygame to set up the game logic and environment. We used `Sequentional()` model to train.

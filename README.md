# Parking Simulation

Self-Parking car simulation using Reinforcement Learning.

## Description

Self-driving car tries to park using reinforcement learning - it is a giving reward when car gets closer to goal it is rewarded and far from the goal it loses the reward. That's how it learns to get closer to the goal and finally park itself. We used pygame to set up the game logic and environment. We used `Sequentional()` model to train.

# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

Sam Harrison

Self Parking Car Simulation

Old project

Team project


## Description

Currently, simulation reasonably models a basic car's movement, but does not train very quickly.

## Objective 1:

New collision detection wihtout using pygame's bitmap checking.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

This will allow our model to train much faster, as it will no longer be bottlenecked by the slow speed of a bitmap check.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

Code showing a lack of pygame's built in collision detection.

## Objective 2:

Create 'headless' version of simulation.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

This will remove the bottleneck of the frame rate on model training time.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

Model can train without the use of a visualization.

## Objective 3:

Train accurate model for car parking.

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**

Car will park more often and quicker.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?**

Accuracy of model based on how often it successfully parks car.

## Stretch goals (optional):

More obstacles.
